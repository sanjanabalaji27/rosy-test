          Hello! My name is Rosy Banerjee, and I am a full stack developer with 2 years of experience creating beautiful, 
          responsive and dynamic web applications. I am passionate about building seamless user experiences that leverage 
          the latest front-end frameworks, while also creating robust and scalable back-end systems.
            
          </p>
          <p>
          Throughout my career, I have developed a deep understanding of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Angular on the front-end, and Node.js, Express.js, and Python on the back-end. I am also experienced with various databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, and I'm well-versed in version control tools such as Git.
          </p>
          <p>
          Overall, I am excited about the endless possibilities of web development, and I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay on the cutting edge of the industry. I am excited to bring my skills and passion to any project, and I look forward to working with you!
